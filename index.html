  <h1> UK House Price Data</h1>
  <h2>I am using monthly averages of house prices throughout the United Kingdom. I am using a dataset from Gov.uk, the most recent data available (as of 12/04/17) which is up to February 2017.<br>
  This data comes in huge quantities, and is often reporting in largely lumoed together sums. I wanted to be able to display the data on a broken down level, by presenting it on a map of the UK, by local area district.</h2>
<br>
  <h3> <a href="houseprice1.html">Here</a> is my first completed d3 graph, using the yearly data from 1995-2017 to depict the average house price in England and Wales</h3>
<br>
  <h3><a href="houseprice2.html">This</a> is a similar graph using d3 to show the average including data from Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, this data wasn't available until 2004 and 2005 respectively, so the long term rise in hosue prices is not as clear to see.</h3>
<br>
  <h3><a href="map/map.html">Here</a> is a choropleth map of the UK (excluding Northern Ireland, as the data is formatted differently), which is interactive for the user. If you click on an area, it will tell you the average house price for February 2017, which is the most recent data available at the time of making this visualisation</h3>
